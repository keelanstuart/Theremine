<b>Theremine</b> is an application that lets you turn your PC into a theremin
by using a <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/">LEAP Motion Controller</a>
to track your hand(s).
</p>
<p>
Hold your hand above the sensor and a tone will be generated that corresponds to the distance from the sensor.
The frequency generated can be tweaked with a minimum, maximum, and step value... and the waveform shape can
be selected from sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth. Volume is modulated with your palm --
palm facing the sensor is full volume while palm facing the side is silent.
