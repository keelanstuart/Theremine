<b>Theremine</b> is an application that lets you turn your PC into a theremin by using a <a href="https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/">LEAP Motion Controller</a> to track your hand(s).
</p>
<p>
Though you can reconfigure Theremine to work like a traditional electronic theremin, the stock configuration uses only one hand to modulate frequency, volume, and a pitch bend function -- with the right hand's distance, fist tightness, and palm normal, respectively. You can change which inputs do what by left-clicking the input column in the effect list... so you could set Left Hand Height for pitch, Right Hand Height for volume, and either hand's Palm Normal - and you would have a "normal" theremin.
